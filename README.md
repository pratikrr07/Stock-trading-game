Stock Trading Game Web Application - https://youtu.be/_oq9CNEi0JI 
--
Project Overview-
This web application serves as a platform for a stock trading game, allowing players to compete by trading stocks based on current NYSE prices. 
The goal is for players to maximise the value of their portfolios by the end of the game period.

Repository Layout
----
This repository is structured as follows:

/models: Contains data models for the application. For instance, player.js defines the schema for player data and game.js define schema for a game.

/routes: Houses the route definitions for the application. players.js manages routes related to player actions. admin.js manages routes related to admin actio like creating a game

/utils: Utility scripts and helpers

/ stockUtils.js for interactions with stock price APIs.

/gameservice.js help in creating a game.

/db.js: Configures and connects to the MongoDB database.

/server.js: The main Express server setup.

/index.js: Bootstraps the application by connecting to the database and starting the server.

/tests: Includes unit tests for server-side logic.

README.md: This document, providing an overview and setup instructions.

package.json: Lists dependencies and defines scripts for the project.

Code Architecture
=
The application is divided into two main components: the server (backend) and the client (frontend).

Backend
=
The backend architecture employs Node.js with Express for routing and MongoDB for data persistence. Hereâ€™s how the components work together:

Model (/models): Defines the structure of data stored in MongoDB. player.js is an example model for player data.

Routes (/routes): Specifies the endpoints and their logic. players.js contains endpoints for player registration and management.

Utilities (/utils): stockUtils.js encapsulates logic for fetching real-time stock prices, using an external API.

Database Connection (/db.js): Establishes a connection to the MongoDB database.

Server (/server.js): Configures the Express server, including middleware and route integration.

Bootstrap (/index.js): Initializes the database connection and starts the Express server.

Frontend
=
Frontend Overview
====
The frontend of our stock trading game application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application features a rich, client-side interface that allows users to interact with the game in real-time, providing functionalities such as user registration, dashboard viewing, stock buying and selling, leaderboard access, and administrative tasks.

Key Components and Functionalities
-------
Register Component
===
Purpose: Facilitates user registration, enabling new players to sign up and participate in the stock trading game.

Technologies Used: React for the component structure, HTML for form layout, and CSS for styling.

Functionality: Captures user input through a form and submits it to the backend to register a new player.

Dashboard Component
===
Purpose: Serves as the main interface for players, displaying their current cash balance, owned stocks, and providing options to buy or sell stocks.

Technologies Used: React for dynamic content updates, axios for making HTTP requests to the backend, and CSS for styling.

Functionality:
Fetches and displays current player information, including cash balances and stock holdings.
Integrates BuyComponent and SellComponent to enable stock transactions.
Displays a leaderboard showing top players.

AdminPage Component
===

Purpose: Allows administrative users to manage game settings, including creating games, renaming players, and providing feedback mechanisms.
Technologies Used: React, axios for API interactions, and CSS for the admin interface design.

Functionality:
Enables game creation with custom start and end times.
Allows for renaming of player accounts.
Incorporates a feedback form for users to leave comments or suggestions.

DeclareWinner Component
===
Integration Point:  its presence in routing suggests functionality for declaring the game's winner, likely an essential feature for the admin user.

Technical Highlights

React Router: Utilized for SPA (Single Page Application) navigation, enabling seamless transitions between different views (Register, Dashboard, AdminPage, DeclareWinner) without reloading the page.
State Management: Uses React's useState and useEffect hooks for state management and side effects, respectively, ensuring that the UI is in sync with the application's state.
Axios: Employed for promise-based HTTP requests to interact with the backend API, fetching data for display or submitting user actions.
CSS: Dedicated CSS files for components (e.g., Dashboard.css, AdminPage.css) ensure modular and maintainable styling across the application.
